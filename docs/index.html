                <ul class="cv-section-items">
                    <li class="cv-item"><p>I am a Senior Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience in analysis,
                        design, development, testing and implementation of all kinds of software. From simple web apps,
                        to API only services or Cloud first apps. Through all those years I've been working with lots
                        different technologies and languages.</p>
                        <p>I have studied computer science at Universidad Tecnologica de Rosario, despite I did not get
                            graduated, it provided me a solid theoretical background which suited perfectly with my
                            working experience.</p>
                        <p>I am a passionate and enthusiastic developer, and I like to dedicate most of my time to code
                            software. I'm self-taught and love to learn new things, from languages, architectures, and
                            methodologies to improve my skills and the quality of my code. Also am a good team player,
                            giving always my best at doing thoughtful and constructive code reviews, on pair-programming
                            sessions or sharing insights with colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Beside my good coding skills, I always like to have a wider view of any project that I'm
                            working on. I like working on a dynamic environment, caring for the business needs and ways
                            to deliver quality and on time, involved on technical decisions, and compromising the
                            quality the less possible in order to have the best software. Always following the pragmatic
                            "Done is better than perfect".</p>
                        <p>I always tend to focus on a main language for a deep dive, currently,it's Golang. Others
                            pasts main languages where Node.JS and PHP.</p></li>
