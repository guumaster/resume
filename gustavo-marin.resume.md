### About

I am a Senior Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience in analysis, design, development, testing and
implementation of all kinds of software. From simple web apps, to API only services or Cloud first apps. Through all
those years I've been working with lots different technologies and languages.

I have studied computer science at Universidad Tecnologica de Rosario, despite I did not get graduated, it provided me a
solid theoretical background which suited perfectly with my working experience.

I am a passionate and enthusiastic developer, and I like to dedicate most of my time to code software. I'm self-taught
and love to learn new things, from languages, architectures, and methodologies to improve my skills and the quality of
my code. Also am a good team player, giving always my best at doing thoughtful and constructive code reviews, on
pair-programming sessions or sharing insights with colleagues.

Beside my good coding skills, I always like to have a wider view of any project that I'm working on. I like working on a
dynamic environment, caring for the business needs and ways to deliver quality and on time, involved on technical
decisions, and compromising the quality the less possible in order to have the best software. Always following the
pragmatic "Done is better than perfect".

I always tend to focus on a main language for a deep dive, currently,it's Golang. Others pasts main languages where
Node.JS and PHP.

### Work Experience

#### Intelygenz

**Technical Lead | Senior Software Engineer**
Sep 2014 – present

Intelygenz is a service company, I started working here as Technical Team Lead for backend Node.JS projects. At that  time, it was very innovative for companies to switch from other languages to Node.

Here I've always been involved on key projects for the company, participating on large projects where I could  help on several aspects of the solutions we delivered to our clients. From technical decisions, to software architecture, and keeping coding good practices and quality through tests, code reviews and mentoring.

As a service company, I've been involved on several projects, this is a list of the most relevant:


- **Konstellation.io** (Oct 2018 – present)
    - Open-source software to build, deploy and evolve AI solutions at any scale. I have being involved in this project since its beginnings, helping the product owner to shape his vision into a viable MVP software, the architecture and its components, and later its final implementation. This project is a great challenge, as there is no other specific software to help close the gap between science teams and developers and devops teams. As part of this project I am working on several phases, coding Golang services, designing the function as a service approach, as well as helping with the deep integration needed with Kubernetes services and APIs.

This was a very large and ambitious project, I helped designing and implementing the microservice architecture interconnected with an event driven system based on Apache Kafka to communicate the different domains. Here I was also part of the team in charge of defining and implementing E2E processes to ensure automation and interoperability between different components. I collaborated in the implementation of a DevOps culture to achieve a good CI/CD environment with shared responsibility over the software lifecycle.

I helped in refactoring the code and architecture to make it more robust and scalable. The code base grew to contain dozens of microservices to interact with BBVA APIs from legacy systems and provide better UI and services to end clients. This project involved lots of complex and interest challenges like integrating third party services, interacting with secure KVM storages, syncing data with BBVA storages, setup auto-scaling for app high demands.
